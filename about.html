            <h1>OUR VISION</h1>
            <p>You can tell the tree by the fruit it bears.
                 You see it through what the organization is
                 delivering as far as a concrete program. If
                  the tree's fruit sours or grows brackish, then the
                  time has come to chop it down
                 - bury it and walk over it and plant new seeds.Labor
                 is prior to, and independent of, capital. Capital is
                 only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed
                  if labor had not first existed. Labor is the superior of capital,
                  and deserves much the higher consideration.Nothing
                  great is created suddenly, any more than a bunch of
                  grapes or a fig. If you tell me that you desire a fig. I answer you that there must be time.
                  Let it first blossom, then bear fruit, then ripen.</p>

    <h1 class="home">OUR MISSION</h1>
    <p class="order2">“Don't be ashamed to weep; 'tis right to
        grieve. Tears are only water, 
       and flowers, trees, and fruit cannot grow without
        water. <br>“Thoughts are roots; Words are leaves;
         Actions are 
        fruits! Every success tree has
         all working normally!” <br>Adopting a new healthier 
         lifestyle can involve changing diet to include more
          fresh fruit and
          vegetables as well as increasing 
          levels of exercise. <br>If your blood is formed
           from eating the foods I teach [fruits and 
           green-leaf vegetables] your soul will shout for
            joy and triumph over all misery of life. For the
            first time you will feel a vibration of 
            vitality through your body (like a slight
           electric current) that shakes you 
           delightfully.</p>

                       <p>Plus, if you let fruit rot, it turns into wine
                 , something brussel sprouts never do.</p>

                       <h1>A fruit is a vegetable with looks and money.</h1>
                   <p>I love fresh fruit and vegetables. I'm not a strict 
                       dieter. I don't think that anything in life should 
                       be so regimented that you're not having fun or can't enjoy like everybody else. Just know 
                       that fresh food is always going to be better for you.</p>

                       <h1>A fruit is a vegetable with looks and money.</h1>
                   <p>Just as you would not neglect seeds that you planted 
                       with hope that they will bear vegetables and fruits 
                       and flowers, so must 
                       you attend to nourish the garden of your becoming</p>
