    <p class="order2">“Don't be ashamed to weep; 'tis right to
         grieve. Tears are only water, 
        and flowers, trees, and fruit cannot grow without
         water. <br>“Thoughts are roots; Words are leaves;
          Actions are 
         fruits! Every success tree has
          all working normally!” <br>Adopting a new healthier 
          lifestyle can involve changing diet to include more
           fresh fruit and
           vegetables as well as increasing 
           levels of exercise. <br>If your blood is formed
            from eating the foods I teach [fruits and 
            green-leaf vegetables] your soul will shout for
             joy and triumph over all misery of life. For the
             first time you will feel a vibration of 
             vitality through your body (like a slight
            electric current) that shakes you
